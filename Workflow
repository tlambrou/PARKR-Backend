- Initial Setup
  - Create Trello
  - Create Repo
  - Install vapor (requires Swift 3.1 or later)
  - Get heroku app up and running
  - GIS tools as needed
  - Slack channel
  - Courseboard product

- Cleaning and prepping data
  - Look for missing data entries
  - Build schema of data that we're keeping

- Load data manually from GeoJSON file into database
  - Build class for data we keep
  - Build route/script for entering into the database from GeoJSON file
  - Create method for checking for duplicates and verifying unique entries

- Creating tools for serving up data on API
 - Method that takes in bounding rectangle of and returns a subset of intersecting blocks using SQL query(s)
 - Method that takes in subset and returns the closest block (Already written for the iOS app)
    - Must also include threshold of nearby distance before returning "nil"
 - Method for returning geocoded address (Already written on for front end)
 - Method that takes in a block's data and returns the next time a person will have to move for that block

- Normalizing data (for each dataset)
  - Build custom model for the dataset (check schema)
  - Method for determining if a line geometry is the same as other geometries in the database
  - Method for checking if data is new and needs to be updated or merged
